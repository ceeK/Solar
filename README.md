A Swift helper for generating Sunrise and Sunset times. 

Solar performs its calculations locally using an algorithm from the [United States Naval Observatory](http://edwilliams.org/sunrise_sunset_algorithm.htm), and thus does not require the use of a network.

## Usage

Solar simply needs a date and a location specified as a latitude and longitude:

```swift
let solar = Solar(for: someDate, coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 51.528308, longitude: -0.1340267))
let sunrise = solar!.sunrise
let sunset = solar!.sunset
```

Use `Date()` for the sunrise and sunset for today:

```swift
let solar = Solar(for: Date(), coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 51.528308, longitude: -0.1340267))
let sunrise = solar!.sunrise
let sunset = solar!.sunset
```

Note that all dates are UTC. Don't forget to format your date into the appropriate timezone if required.

### Types of sunrise and sunset

There are several types of sunrise and sunset that Solar generates. They differ by how many degrees the sun lies below the horizon:

- **Official** (~0째)

- **Civil** (6째 below horizon)

- **Nautical** (12째 below horizon)

- **Astromonical** (18째 below horizon)

For more information, see https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/different-types-twilight.html

## Convenience methods

Solar also comes packaged with some convenience methods:

```swift
// Whether the location specified by the `latitude` and `longitude` is in daytime on `date`
let isDaytime = solar.isDaytime

// Whether the location specified by the `latitude` and `longitude` is in nighttime on `date`
let isNighttime = solar.isNighttime
```

## Installation

Solar is available through CocoaPods and Carthage. 

### Cocoapods

To install, simply add the following line to your podfile:

```ruby
pod "Solar"
```

Then run `pod install`

### Carthage

Add the `ceek/Solar` project to your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile)

```ruby
github "ceeK/Solar"
```

Then run `carthage update`
